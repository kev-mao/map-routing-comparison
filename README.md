# Trip Path Efficiency Comparison: Google Maps vs Apple Maps

With the increasing reliance on navigation apps, it is essential to evaluate and compare the efficiency of different mapping applications. This project focuses on Google Maps and Apple Maps, the two largest navigation applications, aiming to analyze their performance in terms of route efficiency, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and path algorithms. Through the quantitative evaluation of both apps, we can discover which is better to use overal and in unique scenarios.
